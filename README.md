# Advent of Code

What is Advent of code?

Quoted from the [website](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about):

> Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

This repository contains my solutions to the puzzles of Advent of Code. (I'll mainly use C++, but I might use other languages as well.)

## Build

```bash
make YEAR=<year>
